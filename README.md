N8TRW: access a filesystem: reading, writing, renaming, and deleting files.


Since youâ€™ll be touching the target file a lot to trigger changes automatically, you might want to use the watch command to do this automatically:

```shell
$ watch -n 1 touch target.txt
```

Run launch the watcher program using node, like so:

```shell
$ node watcher.js
```

##Reading Command-Line Arguments

$ node watcher-argv.js target.txt
```
